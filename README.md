## **What is Rapid?**

Rapid is a modification to Windows, which removes a lot of useless features of Windows that negatively affect gaming performance.
Rapid is also a good option to reduce system latency, network latency, input lag for maximum focusing on gaming experience.

## **Getting started**
- Download [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/) and the latest [RapidOS Playbook](https://github.com/Rapid-OS/Rapid/releases/latest)
- Launch the AME Wizard and drag the playbook to the dedicated section
- Follow the displayed steps to disable Windows Defender and other system protections
- Apply all system requirements (Requires a system reboot)
- Once the system is restarted you can proceed with the installation and watch the magic happen. (Depending on your systems' power, this can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes)

## **Documentation**
For now, the documentation is only available on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YCPU7EtW6J) server. You can also ask for support.

## **Why Rapid?**

### üîí More private
Stock Windows contains tracking services that collect your data and upload it to Microsoft.
Rapid removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. 

### üöÄ More space
Pre-installed applications and other insignificant components are removed with Rapid. Despite the possibility of minor compatibility issues, this significantly reduces the install size and makes your system more fluent for daily use and gaming. Therefore, a lot of functionalities are stripped completely.

### ‚úÖ More performance
Some tweaked systems on the internet have tweaked Windows too much, breaking compatibility for main features such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and so on.
Rapid is on the sweet point. It aims at getting more performance while maintaining a good level of compatibility.

Some of the many changes that we have done to improve Windows are listed below:
- Two customized power scheme
- Reduced amount of services
- Reduced amount of drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power saving (for personal computers)
- Disabled performance-hungry security mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all devices
- Optimized boot configuration
- Optimized process scheduling

## ü™õ Stripped features
Rapid gets rid of the following services and features:
- Some APPX and UWP applications
- Logging of Network Configuration
- Malicious Removal Tool
- Microsoft Edge and WebView
- Restore Points and System Reset
- Telemetry
- Tools for virus and malware protection (such as SecHealth, HealthCheck, MsMpEng and SmartScreen)
- Windows Defender / Security Center
- Windows Error Reporting
- Windows Updates
- Microsoft OneDrive
- Microsoft OneNote
- Text to Speech

Features disabled by default but can re-enable:

- Hyper-V and VBS
- Background Apps

## ¬©Ô∏è Credits
We sincerely thank [Atlas OS](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas) for their invaluable contribution to this project. Significant portions of code and scripts have been adapted from Atlas OS, contributing significantly to the success of this project.

## üîí Legal
Many custom Windows OSes distribute their systems by providing a tweaked ISO of Windows. Not only it violates [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm), but it is also not a safe way to install.

Rapid is in the process of making a partner with Windows Ameliorated Team to provide users a safer and legal way to install: the [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). With it, Rapid fully complies with [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Rapid-OS is **NOT** a pre-activated version of Windows. You **must** use a valid key to activate Windows. Before buying a Windows 10 (Professional or Home) license, be sure the seller is trustworthy and the key is legitimate ‚Äî no matter where you buy it.

Rapid is based on Microsoft Windows. By using Windows, you agree to [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).
